408term
=======
This is the colaboration center for our group. In the root directory please find PUNCHLIST.txt and TASKS.txt.
As we figure out what needs to be done, we will add things to PUNCHLIST.txt. 
If you see something you'd like to work on, write it under your name in TASKS.txt.

HOW TO GITHUB:

ONLY MAKE CHANGES TO THE FILES THAT YOU INTEND TO KEEP. be clean and concise when changing things. 
don't drag stuff around and destroy the folder structure. 

ONLY upload when you feel like you;ve made a significant change. For instance once you have a working matlab code or if youre refining it thats fine too. 

WHEN YOURE READY TO UPLOAD TO THE HUB:

1) make sure your changes look good in the folder structure
2) dont fuck up anyone elses work
3) open the git hub program
4) select 408term and enter the repo
5) it should ask you to commit your changes, add a title and a description of what you changed
6) click sync (should be top right) and all of your changes will be pushed to the hub
7) anyone else who clicks sync will then pull your changes down and we can all keep up to date

~~~HEY YOU. LOOK AT THIS. IF YOU DONT YOUR SHIT WILL GET FUCKED.~~
DO NOT EDIT AND SYNC A FILE SOMEONE ELSE IS CURRENTLY WORKING ON. IF YOU AND SOMEONE ELSE ARE WORKING ON THE SAME FILE, ABSOLUTELY MAKE SURE TO COORDINATE THAT. 
if not, the last person to sync will overwrite the others work and everyone will be sad. 

so if youre working together, have one person do some stuff and then sync. then you do some stuff and sync.
