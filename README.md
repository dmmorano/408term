408term
=======
This is the colaboration center for our group. In the root directory please find PUNCHLIST.txt and TASKS.txt.
As we figure out what needs to be done, we will add things to PUNCHLIST.txt. 
If you see something you'd like to work on, write it under your name in TASKS.txt.



HOW TO GITHUB:

ONLY MAKE CHANGES TO THE FILES THAT YOU INTEND TO KEEP. be clean and consise when changing things. 
dont drag stuff around and destroy the folder structure. 

ONLY upload when you feel like youve made a significant change. For instance once you have a working matlab code
or if youre refining it thats fine too. 

WHEN YOURE READY TO UPLOAD TO THE HUB:

1) make sure your changes look good in the folder structure
2) dont fuck up anyone elses work
3) open the git hub program
4) select 408term and enter the repo
5) it should ask you to commit your changes, add a title and a description of what you changed
6) click sync (should be top right) and all of your changes will be pushed to the hub
7) anyone else who clicks sync will then pull your changes down and we can all keep up to date




<3 with love,
