	Bathymetry for Narragansett Bay was 
derived from fifteen surveys containing 165,184 
soundings. Three older, less accurate, overlapping 
surveys were entirely omitted, and the overlap from 
six older, less accurate surveys was omitted before 
tinning the data. The average separation between 
soundings was 50 meters. The fifteen surveys used 
dated from 1943 to 1957. The total range of 
sounding data was 1.2 meters to -58.8 meters at 
mean low water. Mean high water values between 
0.9 and 1.4 meters were assigned to the shoreline. 
Four points were found that were not consistent 
with the surrounding data. These were removed 
prior to tinning. Narragansett Bay has thirteen 7.5 
minute DEMs and a single one degree DEM.
