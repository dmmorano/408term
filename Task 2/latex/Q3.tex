Question 3
In terms of the specific wave directions determined from task 1, the inclusion of diffraction models would alter the direction of the wave rays in the ray tracing analysis.Wave diffraction involves a change in direction of waves as they pass through an opening or around a barrier in their path. The amount of diffraction (the sharpness of the bending) increases with increasing wavelength and decreases with decreasing wavelength.
