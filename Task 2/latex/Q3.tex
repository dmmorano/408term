Question 3
In terms of the specific wave directions determined from task 1, the inclusion of diffraction models would alter the direction of the wave rays in the ray tracing analysis.Wave diffraction involves a change in direction of waves as they pass through an opening or around a barrier in their path. The amount of diffraction (the sharpness of the bending) increases with increasing wavelength and decreases with decreasing wavelength. As waves propagate in the wave directions determined from task 1, the waves from one direction might travel a different distance than the wave from another direction. When the difference in distance is a significant difference, the waves from each direction might be in a different phase. Therefore the waves would look more realistic and accurate on the ray tracing analysis.
