Question 1:
The results of this study would prove very useful for the estimation of sediment transport at Narraganset Beach. The wave ray analysis provides good incite as to the interaction waves may have with the beach. Areas of high wave activity can be easily spotted with the high resolution wave ray analysis used in this study. The direction of incident wave fronts can also be determined. However, in able to do a proper sediment transport analysis for this beach, further information would be necessary. In order to determine the extent to which the ocean interacts with the beach, wave energy analysis would need to be conducted. The properties of the sediment present at Narragansett Beach would also need to be investigated in order to produce an accurate model.
